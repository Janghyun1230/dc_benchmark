# DCBench

This is the official codebase for paper DC-BENCH: [Dataset Condensation Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.09639).

# Condensed Data
We provide all condensed data [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1trp0MyUoL9QrbsdQ8w7TxgoXcMJecoyH?usp=sharing), this will be needed to reproduce the benchmark results. Please see the following sections for details on how to use the data.

# How to set up
## Step 1
Run the following command to download the benchmark.
```
git clone git@github.com:justincui03/dc_benchmark.git
```
## Step 2
Download all(or part) of the data from [this shared link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1trp0MyUoL9QrbsdQ8w7TxgoXcMJecoyH?usp=sharing) and put them under <em>distilled_results</em> folder in the project root directory.

The project structure should look like the following:
- dc_benchmark
  - distilled_results
    - DC
    - DSA
    - ...
  - evaluator
  - methods
  - networks
  - ...

### Step 3
Run the following command to create a conda environment
```
cd dc_benchmark
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

# Run an evaluation
Running an evaluation is very simple with DCBench
```
bash eval.sh --dataset CIFAR10 --ipc 1 --model convnet --aug autoaug
```
Here are the configurable parameters
- dataset: choose between CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and tinyimagenet
- ipc: choose between 1, 10 and 50
- model: choose between convnet, convnet4, mlp, resnet18, resnet152, etc
- aug: choose between autoaug, randaug, imagenet_aug, dsa,etc

# Neural Architecture Search
We incorparete the standard NAS-Bench-201 library into our codebase.
You can start a simple NAS experiment by running the following command
```
cd darts-pt
bash darts-201.sh --dc_method tm
```
- dc_method: which dataset condensation method to test, choose between random, kmeans-emb, dc, dsa, dm, tm
