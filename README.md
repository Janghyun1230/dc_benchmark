This is the official codebase for paper DC-BENCH: [Dataset Condensation Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.09639).  
It covers the following:  
- Condensed Dataset
- How to set up 
- Ran an evaluation
- How to integrate
- Commands to reproduce all the SOTA methods


# Condensed Data üíæ
We provide all condensed data [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1trp0MyUoL9QrbsdQ8w7TxgoXcMJecoyH?usp=sharing), this will be needed to reproduce the benchmark results. Please see the following sections for details on how to use the data.

# How to set up ‚öôÔ∏è
## Step 1 
Run the following command to download the benchmark.
```
git clone git@github.com:justincui03/dc_benchmark.git
```
## Step 2
Download all(or part) of the data from [this shared link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1trp0MyUoL9QrbsdQ8w7TxgoXcMJecoyH?usp=sharing) and put them under <em>distilled_results</em> folder in the project root directory.   
The project structure should look like the following:    
- dc_benchmark
  - distilled_results
    - DC
    - DSA
    - ...
  - ...

### Step 3
Run the following command to create a conda environment
```
cd dc_benchmark
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

# Run an evaluation üöÄ
Running an evaluation is very simple with DCBench.  
Simply run the following command from the project root director you just downloaded.
```
bash scripts/eval.sh --dataset CIFAR10 --ipc 1 --model convnet --aug autoaug
```
Here are the configurable parameters
- dataset: choose between CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and tinyimagenet
- ipc: choose between 1, 10 and 50
- model: choose between convnet, convnet4, mlp, resnet18, resnet152, etc
- aug: choose between autoaug, randaug, imagenet_aug, dsa,etc

# Neural Architecture Search üîç
We incorparete the standard NAS-Bench-201 library into our codebase.
You can start a simple NAS experiment by running the following command
```
cd darts-pt
bash darts-201.sh --dc_method tm
```
- dc_method: which dataset condensation method to test, choose between random, kmeans-emb, dc, dsa, dm, tm

For the detailed setup, please refer to [DARTS-PT

# How to integrate ü§î
**DC-Bench** is designed to be extensible. In the following sections, we will introduce how to integrate new methods and introduce new datasets which can be as simple as a few lines of code. 
## Integrate a new method
A new method can be introduced in the following 3 steps:
- Define a new dataloader(if not already exist)
- Config the code to use the new dataloader
- Run the eval command same as all other methods

A detailed tutorial can be found [**new method integration**](docs/new_method.md)üöÄ


## Introduce a new dataset
Introducing a new dataset is even easier, it can be done in the following 2 steps:  
- Extend the code to read from the new dataset(if the dataset is not already included in pytorch)
- Run the eval command by specifying the new dataset

## SOTA commands ‚ù§Ô∏è
We collected all the commands to reproduce the SOTA synthetic results in our codebase. All the parameters are provided by the original authors.   
- Commands for [DC](methods/dc/readme.md)
- Commands for [DSA](methods/dc/readme.md)
- Commands for [DM](methods/dc/readme.md)
- Commands for [TM](methods/tm/readme.md)
